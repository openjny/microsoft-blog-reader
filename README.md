# Microsoft Blog Reader

**Live Site**: https://openjny.github.io/microsoft-blog-reader

A lightweight aggregator for Microsoft Tech Community blogs with fast search and category filtering.

## Why?

- **No unified view**: Microsoft Tech Community has 150+ individual blogs, but no single page to browse the latest posts across all topics
- **Slow search**: The official site's search is sluggish and lacks category filtering
- **Lightweight alternative**: A fast, static site with instant client-side search

## Features

- **Cross-blog aggregation**: View latest articles from all Microsoft Tech Community blogs in one place
- **Fast search**: Instant client-side keyword search across titles and descriptions
- **Category filter**: Filter by topic (AI, Security, Azure, etc.)
- **Extended RSS**: Subscribe to a feed with more articles than the official RSS
